The definition of mobility has completely changed today with the emergence of smartphones having same computing power as laptops. Laptop was an incredible invention that made it easy to carry work with you but it was just the beginning. Smartphones can now accomplish almost all the tasks a laptop can perform, and with the user behavior shifting from simple voice telephony to data consumption and creation, the smartphone has become the ideal tool.

Before we go ahead it is important to understand what is Enterprise Mobility? It is simply the new technology paradigm to improve the productivity by allowing employees and customers to access corporate data, resources and application freely and securely from anywhere and at any time.

It is not just asking IT admin to enable smartphones for enterprise usage but it is something that will transform the business and create new business models to generate new revenue streams. Enterprise mobility brings improved opportunities for collaboration across time zones, national boundaries, and continents.

There are purpose-built platforms or appliances for all established enterprise solutions today. Likewise there is a requirement for a platform that could encapsulate and serve enterprise mobility requirements at once. A key component of that platform will be an app store for Enterprise Apps.

Users should be able to downloan enterprise apps on their devices without any intervention from IT. And instantly use them to perform the tasks related to their job profiles. It will be interesting if the users can download apps from various marketplaces and connect IT’s enterprise data stores to extract data into the apps to use it for the business purpose. ‘Bring Your Own Application’ (BYOA) will become a new trend.

There will be few challenges as well in adoption of Enterprise Mobility. Some of them are:

1. Security: BYOD & Mobile Device Management are still in evolution phase and will take some more time to reach maturity. To address current gaps in the solutions, it is important for IT to have a strong mobile policy and security in place.

2. Connectivity: Challenges related to getting access via VPN. User adoption will be a key to secured infrastructure. 

3. Porting: Porting of Enterprise Web Applications to Mobile Apps with support to standard operating systems like iOS, Android, Blackberry, Windows Mobile etc. 

4. Compatability: Mobile applications need to be compatible within the operating systems available in the enterprise mobility space.

Also, it will not be wise to create mobile apps for all the enterprise applications. Most of the enterprise data structures are not designed with mobility in mind. They are built for providing access through BI tools such as Sharepoint, Cognos, Business Objects etc. In-memory databases solve the problem of speed of delivery to the end point but they also require giant servers with huge amount of RAM to allow in-memory operations. Infrastructure investments will become cost-intensive in order to provide acceptable rendering times to mobile users.

In a nutshell, coming time will experience a sudden surge in the business requirements to provide access to corporate data via multiple devices and multitude of operating systems. There will be an evolution in IT stack that will serve the needs of enterprise users by creating foundational building blocks such as enterprise store for mobility apps, APIs and wrappers for faster integration of data in apps, HTML5 for engaging user experience, nimble ways to extract, prepare and deliver the enterprise data.
