The definition of mobility has completely changed today with the emergence of smartphones having same computing power as laptops. Laptop was an incredible invention that made it easy to carry work with you but it was just the beginning. Smartphones can now accomplish almost all the tasks a laptop can perform, and with the user behavior shifting from simple voice telephony to data consumption and creation, the smartphone has become the ideal tool.

Before we go ahead it is important to understand what is Enterprise Mobility? It is simply the new technology paradigm to improve the productivity by allowing employees and customers to access corporate data, resources and application freely and securely from anywhere and at any time.

It is not just asking IT admin to enable smartphones for enterprise usage but it is something that will transform the business and create new business models to generate new revenue streams. Enterprise mobility brings improved opportunities for collaboration across time zones, national boundaries, and continents.

There are purpose-built platforms or appliances for all established enterprise solutions today. Few examples of the platforms are SAP ERP for enterprise resource planning, Websphere for application and middleware integration, Tibco for enterprise messaging, SCCM or Radia for end point configuration management, OAM for security and access control etc. Likewise there is a requirement for a platform or appliance that could encapsulate and serve enterprise mobility requirements at once. There are five key components that are required to create a platform or appliance for enterprise mobility:

Enterprise Apps:
Vver 80 billion apps are downloaded from two of biggest online stores: iTunes and Google Play. Quick account setup, extremely appealing user interface, billions of free apps, efficient download process and amazing synchronization capabilities among various devices has revolutionized mobile industry. These new Apps marketplaces were mainly responsible for propelling the demand for mobile devices in an unprecedented way.

According to Cisco Systems, more people are now using mobile devices which are driving huge increases in mobile Internet traffic that will reach 134 exabytes a year by 2017. The 134 exabytes is equivalent to 134 times all the Internet traffic – both wired and mobile – generated in 2000. In 2012, the average mobile user every month spent one hour watching video and two hours on audio, had one video call and downloaded one app. By 2017, the average mobile user will watch 10 hours of video a month and spend 15 hours on audio, will be on five video calls and will download 15 apps.

The same concept of Apps is getting extended to the enterprise space now.

There will be enterprise apps stores containing a catalogue of enterprise mobile apps available to the users for download. Users will be able to get these apps on their devices without any intervention from IT and use it instantly to perform the tasks related to their job profiles. What will be interesting is when users will download apps from other marketplaces and connect IT’s enterprise data stores to extract data into the apps to use it for the business purpose. ‘Bring Your Own Application’ (BYOA) will become a new trend.

Enterprise Mobility Challenges:

Security is the biggest challenge. BYOD & Mobile Device Management are still in evolution phase and will take some more time to reach maturity. To address current gaps in the solutions, it is important for IT to have a strong mobile policy and security in place. 

* Connectivity challenges related to getting access via VPN. User adoption will be a key to secured infrastructure. 

* Enterprise App Store Applications need to be compatible with all operating systems available in the enterprise mobility space; each of which has multiple OS versions. 

* Porting of Enterprise Web Applications to Mobile Apps with support to standard operating systems like iOS, Android, Blackberry, Windows Mobile etc. 

* Most of the enterprise data structures are not designed with mobility in mind. They are built for providing access through BI tools such as Sharepoint, Cognos, Business Objects etc. In-memory databases solve the problem of speed of delivery to the end point but they also require giant servers with huge amount of RAM to allow in-memory operations. Infrastructure investments will become cost-intensive in order to provide acceptable rendering times to mobile users.

In a nutshell, coming time will experience a sudden surge in the business requirements to provide access to corporate data via multiple devices and multitude of operating systems. There will be an evolution in IT stack that will serve the needs of enterprise users by creating foundational building blocks such as enterprise store for mobility apps, APIs and wrappers for faster integration of data in apps, HTML5 for engaging user experience, nimble ways to extract, prepare and deliver the enterprise data.
