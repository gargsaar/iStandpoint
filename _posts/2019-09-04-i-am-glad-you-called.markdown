Rahul works with IBM, New York. It has been 6 years since he moved to the US right after his graduation. He is single and lives with his parents. It's his birthday today. He has planned to take his mom and dad out for a dinner after a long time. He doesn't speak to them much. Like every year, he tried calling Tina as the first thing on his birthday. She didn't answer the call. 

Tina lives in Mumbai with her daughter Samira. Back in college, Tina and Rahul were like eyes of a face, always together. Tina  always stood for her dignity and decisions. She was fearless and welcomed the future in all of it’s unknown mystery. Rahul was bright, emotional, and timid. He couldn't go against his parents. As opposite attracts, they too got attracted and fell in love.

When he was about to leave for office, around 10AM, his phone rang. It was Tina. A promising smile emerged on his face. 
Last they spoke was 6 years back on their graduation day. His heart started beating faster. 

In absolute surprise, he pressed the green button.

"Hi Rahul," she said in a low and soothing voice.

"Hi," he replied in a similar tone.

"Happy Birthday!"

He didn’t reply. After a pause, he said, "Tina, I'm sorry."

A tear rolled down from his eye. He started crying. He didn’t utter a word for the next few minutes, just cried. She too felt the emotions.

He recomposed himself, and said the same thing, "I'm sorry."

He continued, "I feel sorry every day, every moment for 6 years now. Please forgive me."

She tried to console, "don’t cry, it's your birthday."

A thought of forgiveness appeared in her heart for a second. But the wound he had given to her was too deep. It was not willing to heal.

In a strong voice she said, "Rahul, time is a great healer. I've moved on in life and learned how to live alone. Samira wanted to speak to you. It's her birthday. I had promised her that she will speak to her Papa on her 5th birthday, and I never break promises."

The new born hope in his heart, which had appeared after seeing her call for the first time in 6 years, disappeared in a jiffy. He craved for her even more, like a child who catcall for a toy its parents can't afford.

Ruefully he replied, "I was helpless. Mom and dad were about to commit suicide. I had to choose between you and them, and I made a mistake."

"It wasn’t just a mistake Rahul. You ruined my life." She replied angrily.

She continued, "I was just 20 when you had pregnant me with your child. It wasn’t my baby alone, but only I suffered. I know you love me, however, you love your parents more. That was your decision, now it’s my turn. Sorry, I can't forgive you."

He couldn’t say a word more.

Next, it was Samira on phone.

In a cute voice she said, "Papa, happy birthday."

In crying voice he replied, "Happy birthday to you too, Samira."

Tina took the phone back in a flash and said, "Rahul, it's getting dark here, we need to go."

Soaked in love, he didn’t want the call to end.

Quickly, he asked, "how is Samira?"

"What you expect of someone who shares your birth date. She is exactly like you." she replied and ended the call.

His heart wept. He knew that she will never come back, and now, it was even more difficult for him to live without her. Yet he smiled. "Atleast she called," he thought and moved on.

*Some mistakes can never be forgiven, specially when they are done to somebody you love the most.*
