Rahul works with IBM in New York. It has been 6 years since he moved to the US right after his graduation. He is a bachelor and lives with his parents. Today is his birthday. He has planned to take his mom and dad out for a dinner after a long time. He doesn't speak to them much. Like every year, he tried calling Tina as the first thing on his birthday. She didn't answer his call. Last they spoke was 6 years back on their graduation day.

Tina lives in Mumbai with her daughter Samira. Back in college, Tina and Rahul were like two eyes of a face, always together, no matter where you see. Tina always stood for her dignity. She was fearless and welcomed the future in all of it’s unknown mystery. Rahul was not bold unlike Tina. He could’t go against his parents. As opposite attracts, they too got attracted and fell in love.

When he was about to leave for office, around 10AM, his phone rang. It was Tina. A promising smile emerged on his face. His heart started beating faster. In absolute surprise and joy, he pressed the green button.

"Hi Rahul," she said in a low soothing voice.

"Hi," he replied in the same tone.

"Happy Birthday," she said.

He didn’t reply. After a pause, he said, "Tina, I'm sorry."

A tear rolled down from his eye. He started crying. He didn’t utter a word for the next few minutes, just cried. She too felt the emotions.

He recomposed himself, and said the same thing, "I'm sorry."

He continued, "I feel sorry for my mistake every day, every moment for 6 years now. Please forgive me."

She broke her silence, "Don’t cry. It's your birthday."

She continued, "Rahul, time is great healer. I've moved on and learned how to live alone. Samira who wanted to speak to you, it's her birthday today. I had promised her that she will speak to her papa on her 5th birthday. And I never break my promise. Nothing has changed between us."

The new born hope in his heart disappeared in a jiffy. He craved for her even more, like a child who catcall at a store when its parents deny to buy a toy they can't afford.

Next, it was Samira on phone.

In a cute voice she said, "Papa, Happy Birthday."

In crying voice, he replied, "Thank You Samira. Happy Birthday to you too."

Tina took the phone back, "Rahul, it's getting dark here, we need to go."

Drenched in love, he didn’t want the call to end.

Quickly, he asked, "How is Samira?"

"She is exactly like you," she replied and ended the call.

*Some mistakes can never be forgiven, specially when they are done by somebody you love the most.*
