Rahul works with IBM, New York. It has been 6 years since he moved to the US right after his graduation. He is a bachelor and lives with his parents. It's his birthday today. He has planned to take his mom and dad out for a dinner after a long time. He doesn't speak to them much. Like every year, he tried calling Tina as the first thing in the morning. As always, she didn't answer the call. Last they spoke was 6 years back on their graduation day.

Tina lives in Mumbai with her daughter Samira. Back in college, Tina and Rahul were like eyes of your face, always together, no matter where you see. Tina always stood for her dignity. She was fearless and welcomed the future in all of it’s unknown mystery. Rahul was shy and timid. Unlike Tina, he could’t go against his parents. As opposite attracts, they too got attracted and fell in love.

When he was about to leave for office, around 10AM, his phone rang. It was Tina. A promising smile emerged on his face. His heart started beating faster. In absolute surprise and joy, he pressed the green button.

"Hi, Rahul!" She said in a low and soothing voice.

"Hi!" He replied in a similar tone.

"Happy Birthday!" She said.

He didn’t reply. After a pause, he said, "Tina, I'm sorry."

A tear rolled down from his eye. He started crying. He didn’t utter a word for the next few minutes, just cried. She too felt the emotions.

He recomposed himself, and said the same thing, "I'm sorry."

He continued, "I feel sorry every day, every moment for 6 years now. Please forgive me."

She tried to console, "Don’t cry. It's your birthday."

A thought of forgiveness appeared in her heart for a second. But the wound he had given to her was too deep and not willing to heal.

In a strong voice she continued, "Rahul, time is a great healer. I've moved on in life and learned how to live alone. Samira wanted to speak to you. I had promised her that she will speak to her Papa on her 5th birthday, and it's her birthday today. I never break my promise unlike you."

The new born hope, which had appeared in his heart after seeing her call for the first time in 6 years, disappeared in a jiffy. He craved for her even more, like a child who catcall for a toy its parents can't afford.

Ruefully he said, "I was helpless. Mom and dad were about to commit suicide. I had to choose between you and them, and I made a mistake."

"It wasn’t just a mistake Rahul. You ruined my life." She replied angrily.

She continued, "I was just 20 when you had pregnant me with your child. It wasn’t my baby alone, but only I suffered. I know you love me, but you love your parents more. You had made your decision, now it’s my turn. Sorry, I can't forgive you."

He couldn’t say a word more.

Next, it was Samira on phone.

In a cute voice she said, "Papa, happy birthday."

In crying voice he replied, "Happy birthday to you too, Samira."

Tina took the phone back in a flash and said, "Rahul, it's getting dark here, we need to go."

Soaked in love, he didn’t want the call to end.

Quickly, he asked, "How is Samira?"

"She is exactly like you," she replied and ended the call.

*Some mistakes can never be forgiven, specially when they are done to somebody you love the most.*
