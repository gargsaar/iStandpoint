Fellow toastmasters, good afternoon!

William Shakespeare said, “all the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players who have their entrances and exits;” I made an entrance in this world some time ago, but that’s not important. What’s important is the journey so far.

One thing I like about Toastmasters is that it gives you ample opportunities to market yourself, and Ice Breaker is one such opportunity. But as we all know that no marketing can be effective if the product is bogus, likewise, no speech is impressive if it doesn’t deliver a message. 

So, today, I’ll talk about something important, that is – what is the purpose of life.

An intricate characteristic of we humans in general is that we don’t value things we easily get. For example, our life. And because we don’t value life, we end up living it without any purpose. But purpose is so important in life. When there is a purpose in life, it makes an ordinary life, extraordinary. 

Since I had no purpose, so my early life was controlled by Sharma uncle, our neighbor. For example, when I was 15, I joined music class, not because I liked music, but because Sharma uncle’s son was learning tabla. For me, tabla was still ok, but the sad part was that I had to learn dholak becasue tabla classes were full.

The worst happened when I cracked School Of Planning And Architecture in Delhi, the best architecture college in the country, but didn’t join because Sharma uncle told dad - architechture is a waste, put him into engineering. And I was so naïve and purposeless that I joined engineering and thesuffering began. 

When architecture students were studying history and romance which they used in their lives, I was studying chemical bonding. And that too in a class where the only girl was not willing to look at us. How were we supposed to understand the concept of bonding? On one hand the lucky oxygen atom was involved in a twosome with two hydrogen atoms, and we were struggling to find even a single girl. You know the matter of fact is, when you don’t want to do engineering and you end doing it - you learn just two things: one, how to get rid of our google chrome history, and two, how to use google chrome incognito.

As Sharma uncle said, I got a job. I, who was initially having energy and charm, just few years in IT, I lost all my charm. I turned dull and boring like a used underwear.

Then came the moment of awakening. 

One lousy evening, I was browsing youtube videos sitting on a couch. I came across a TEDx video of a man whose startup recently got $100 mn funding, who visited 152 countries in last 2 years, and shook hands with Bill Gates, Waren Buffet, and Elon Musk, all my role models whose only thing I could manage to touch was a photo on my mobile phone. 

Suddenly, I jumped out of the couch, in shock or surprise – whatever that weird feeling was, to realize that the man is Kunal Prasad, my batch mate from engineering. Kunal Prasad – no way. That guy was so ordinary - mediocre grades, average intelligence, and personality - we used to call him cauliflower. 

What made Kunal special was - he had a purpose in life. He always wanted to be an entrepreneur.

That moment I decided – I want my life was as exciting as this guy’s. I no longer want to live a life without a purpose.

So here I’m, standing in front of you all, delivering a speech, what if not for TEDx, but with a purpose to become a great toastmaster. And I believe toastmaster is that wonderful program which can make you BIG. 

B: Believer: toastmaster gives you the skills and the confidence to make your audience people in you.

I: Invest in yourself: toastmaster comples you to learn and read. And as leaders say, "Leaders are readers, and readers are leaders."

G: Go places: toastmaster makes you famous. It can take you places.

I’ll end my speech with the answer to the question that I raised in the beginning – what is the purpose of life. 

I belive the purpose of life is - to live a life of purpose.

Thank You!
