It was a Saturday morning. Maa was ready with the paratha, an Indian bread filled with onion. Doing the same thing for 10 years now, she had perfected the art. Baba wanted onion parathas every morning. Even Dadi, who was enjoying omelette in heaven, didn't know when was the last time he ate anything else. I liked omelette, but who cared what I liked.

I could finish only one by the time he had finished three. I wanted to have one more, but he would not wait. Maa looked at me. I thought she would throw the rolling pin to break his head into two. She did nothing. She wanted my permission to ask him if he could wait, as it was just a matter of minutes. I said 'No'. I didn’t want her to get a scold because of me.

I said no to her for two more reasons: I didn’t want to walk for 2 kilometres as I needed to preserve energy for the football match; and it was the only time when I could learn how to drive Chetak. Our scooter, his only thing I was interested in.

Engrossed in Chetak, I reached school in no time. Chetak stopped at the school gate. I got down and it went off in a jiffy. I hoped that Baba would wish me luck for the match, but I knew, it was a half-hearted hope.

Just a step further, I turned back to realise that there was a coin on the road. A kind that I had never seen before. In bold letters, it said KUWAIT.

We lost the match, but I was elated. Maa was flummoxed. Baba was sherlock. He was looking for something since he came home that evening. He had unsettled the house. She tried to inquire, a couple of times, but all in vain. 

Furiously, she asked, "what are you looking for?"

"Nothing."

She knew the answer won’t come easily, so she tried again.

"A coin," he replied, finally, in a hope for help.

"What coin?"

He said, "KUWAIT."

"KUWAIT, what?"

He didn’t reply as it was confirmed that she knew nothing about it.

But I knew.

I couldn’t believe it was his. For a person who had never stepped out of Meerut, how did he get the coin? And, why was the coin so special? 

I'm sure grandma would have the answers, but she was relaxing on a beach in heaven, and hence, not reachable. I knew if I ask him, I would get only one thing - a slap.

I was in seventh heaven. Finally, the time had come to take revenge. I wanted vengeance for the parathas I couldn’t eat. I was certain that I would never give him that coin at any cost, even if Dadi comes and plead.  

He didn’t stop. He yelled at her, once again. She never said anything to him. Her strength was her weakness. But this time, she lost the strength to be patient anymore.

She shouted, "who will put the things back in order, your father?"

He ran towards her. I came in between. I opened my fist to show him the coin. I didn’t give it to him. His hand came down on my cheek. I still didn’t give it to him. He turned towards her. I gave it to him. 

For the first time in my life I had something I never wanted to give to anybody, not even Dadi. And certainly not to him. I hated him the most.

The night got dark, but I was still awake. Suddenly, the door of my room opened. I expected Maa, but it was Baba. 

He came in and sat next to me. He took out the coin from his pocket and gave it to me.

"I got it from your grandpa. It was the only thing I had of him. I knew I'll have to let it go one day. Let it be today. Take care of it." he said and left the room.

An unanticipated tear rolled down my eye. For a moment, I wanted to hug him.

*Love is a feeling that has no standard language. Every person has its own way of reflection.*
