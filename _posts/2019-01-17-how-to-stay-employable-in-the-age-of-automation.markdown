*“A man who can be replaced by a machine, will be.”*

I’m with those who believe that AI will replace humans, but I believe, the change will be for good. And my belief is for the reason that we, humans, are special. To tell u why - let me tell you a story.

Yesterday, I met Ashish during an Uber ride. When I last knew Ashish, about 6 months back, he used to clean my cars. He was a young lad, who had come to Noida with his father for work. He belonged to a very primitive and backward village in Bihar. He had never been to a school, never used a smartphone, and the only thing he knew to drive was a bullock-cart. Noida was a complete new world for him - the language was alien, people were different, culture was strange.    

It was a shock for me to see how Ashish has transformed himself, and that too in just 6 months. It's amazing how he has upgraded his skills and become an Uber driver as for him I am sure this wouldn't have been easy. According to him it was the only way he could have survied in the city. He is a true example of how people transform themselves for their betterment.

Ten years ago I couldn’t have imagined driving a cab in Delhi being less stressful and more paying. Moreover, idea like carpooling, was never a viable option before the launch of these mobile apps. The reason Uber has become successful and drivers make a good income is technological advancements. Because of advance algorithm, Uber rides today are optimized i.e. more rides at a less expense and time.

However, I wonder how long things will remain same for Ashish or for all of us. Jobs are changing fast. The hope is that technology growth will lead to creation of many more new layer of jobs that did not exist before and will divert humans towards a fulfilling work environment. The fear is, it will increase the unemployment rate many fold. 

For an example, we keep hearing about self-driving cars test failures and crashes and feel we are still many years away from getting rid of ‘human drivers’. However, scientifically speaking, there is no better way to learn and perfect a machine but failures. Each of these crashes is generating a tremendous amount of data to rapidly improve self-driving cars. Self-driving cars will further optimize the Uber rides and significantly reduce cost. However, it will also make hundred thousand taxi drivers in Delhi alone jobless. Not just the drivers but many other jobs in other sectors are also similarly in jeopardy because of technological advances and machine learning.

The whole purpose of technology evolution is that things should not remain the same. As we are moving from the Industrial age to the information age, the number of jobs in the human labor class will start to shrink since automation and machines can perform these jobs with higher efficiency. The idea is not to eliminate the labor force, but to migrate them from the bottom of the pyramid towards the top. However, the skills that would be required for the jobs of future will be completely different.

For better or for worse the change is imminent. Being an optimist I believe the change is going to be for better. To stay relevant in the future or win the battle of employability against machines, humanity as a whole, will have to upgrade like Ashish. To achieve a sanguine future, we will have to constantly evolve and learn new skills which I believe is the only way out.

*"If you are willing to learn, no one can stop you. If you are not, no one can help you."*
