One day while researching on different styles of leaderships, I learned about paternalistic style of leadership.

In our lives we often come across people who do a lot for us but we don't realise. Talking about myself, my younger brother is one such person in my life. He is somebody who is the go-to destination for me for getting things done, moral and emotional support, and day-to-day advices. He is a true example of a Paternalistic Leader.  

This style of leadership is pretty common where the culture is very hierarchical and group oriented, in regions such as Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, or you can say about 67% of the world’s population. 

A Parent Leader following the Paternalistic Leadership style leads as if he/she is the parent in the family. They exhibit controlling and caring attitude at the same time and offer guidance and protection. In exchange all they want is loyalty and respect. Their style is not simply authoritarian, but authority with a long-term vested interest in all the members at play. 

*Some of the characterstics of a parent leader are:*

A Parent Leader leads the organization/team like they are a family. For example, if you are hosting a housewarming party, they are surely going to show up. They hate feeling of left out and there is nothing worse when they are not involved.

They values loyalty above all other characteristics. They would prefer someone who, when the ship starts to sink, will tie themselves to the mast as compared to hotshots who come in and think they are great but are ready to jump ship for a better offer. For them nothing will destroy the trust faster than any attempt that smells of disloyalty.

They makes decisions based on intuition and prefers things to be done “their way”. For them, the past is often frozen in a beautiful, perfect (or at least good-enough) picture and places an extremely high value on “the way we used to do it/always have done it”. The phrase “just trust me” is often used as a way to end discussions.

A Parent Leader delegates duties, but not authority. They hold the final authority and while they will expect others to do their part.

*Sound like someone you know?*

I think anyone can be a parent leader. If the purpose of your life is to live for your family, you are a parent leader. People usually fail not because of the circumstances or the lack of a better approach. More often than not they fail because they don’t have the right leader to carry them through the thick and thin while achieving their dreams. Parent leaders like my brother are those who burn themselves to let others go that extra mile.
