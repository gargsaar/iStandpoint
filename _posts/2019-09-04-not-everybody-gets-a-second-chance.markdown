Rahul works with IBM, New York. It has been 6 years since he moved to the US right after his graduation. He is single and lives with his parents. It's his birthday today. He has planned to take his mom and dad out for a dinner after a long time. He doesn't speak to them much. Like every year, he tried calling Tina as the first thing on his birthday. She didn't answer the call. 

Tina lives in Mumbai with her daughter Samira. Back in college, Tina and Rahul were like eyes of a face, always together. Tina  always stood for her decisions. She was fearless and welcomed the future in all of it’s unknown mystery. Rahul was bright, emotional, and timid. He couldn't go against his parents. As opposite attracts, they too got attracted and fell in love.

When he was about to leave for office, around 10 in the morning, his phone rang. It was Tina. A promising smile emerged on his face. 

Last time they spoke was 6 years back on their graduation day. 

In absolute joy, he swiped the green button.

"Hi Rahul," she said in a low voice.

A tear rolled down his eye. All he has been wanting for 6 years was to speak to her, but when the moment was here, he couldn't speak a word. 

There was a silence, long and expected.

After a pause, he gathered the strength to say, "I'm sorry."

He knew that this was his only chance.

He continued, "I feel sorry every day, every moment for 6 years now. Please forgive me."

She felt the emotion. A thought of forgiveness appeared in her heart for a second, but the wound he had given her was too deep, unhealable, always in front of her.

In a strong voice she said, "Rahul, time is a great healer. I've moved on in life and learned how to live alone. Samira wanted to speak to you. I had promised her that she will speak to her father on her fifth birthday. I never break promise."

The hope of getting her back fainted in a jiffy. He craved for her like a child who catcall for a toy its parents can't afford.

Ruefully he replied, "I was helpless. Mom and dad were about to commit suicide. I had to choose between you and them. I made a mistake."

"It was a mistake for you, but it ruined my life." She replied.

"I was just 20 when I was pregnant. It wasn’t my baby alone, but only I suffered. I know you loved me, but you choose to love your parents more. That was your decision, now it’s my turn. Sorry, I can't forgive you."

Next, it was Samira on phone.

In a cute voice she said, "Papa, happy birthday."

Chocked, he couldn't reply.

Tina took the phone back. "Goodbye Rahul, we need to go."

Soaked in love, he didn’t want the call to end. Quickly, he asked, "how is Samira?"

"What you expect of someone who even shares your birth date. She is exactly like you." she replied and ended the call.

His heart wept. He knew that she will never come back, and now, it was even more difficult for him to live without her. She called, he thought and smiled.

*Some mistakes can never be forgiven, specially when they are done to somebody you love the most.*
