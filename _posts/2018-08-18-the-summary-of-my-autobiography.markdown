I'll be a proud man the day I'll publish my autobiography. It will be the most satisfying accomplishment. A dream which seems far from reality, but will be a reality one day. 

Today, let me wear my creative hat and write the summary of to be written autobiography. I'll title it 'Life of a Creative Engineer'.

'Life of a Creative Engineer' will be divided into 3 parts. 

Part 1 will have stories of my childhood. This part will begin with a story about how I came into this world. I still remember why it was a Breaking News!

William Shakespeare said “All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances.”                                       

I made my entry in this world once upon a time. I was born in a city about 60 kms from Delhi. I was the first boy of my generation. My grandma was extremely happy with the news of my birth. She was so excited that she ran with all enthusiasm to see me in the hospital room. She was a strong woman. She pushed the door of the room with full power without realising that Dr. Kirti Vyas, my gynecologist, was standing behind the door. Dr. Kirti was a thin and elegant young lady. Frightened with grandma’s sudden attack, she fell flat on the ground. She broke her nose. Unfortunate for her, but the news of my birth became a breaking news!

Part 2 will take readers into my youth. They will get to read amazing stories about a Nice Guy, who finished last, but won.

I was very popular in college. I used to give support, do favors, do everything consistent with the general meaning of the term nice. Infact, I was so nice that I never ever took advantage of drunken friends while escorting them back from parties to their beds, no matter how much they insisted. I was the perfect boyfriend material who never ended up being a boyfriend. 

For all the nice guys out there and ladies who are single, I want say that nice guys may not end up being boyfriends, but trust me, they are very good husband material.

Part 3 will talk about my struggles and glory. It will narrate how I shaped my life to make it immortal. What I did so that my memories remained. It will be an inspiration for those who think they are fortunate to have a life in which they can see, hear and speak. It will be for those want to make their life count.

I'm sure it will be an interesting read. When the journey has begun, no destination is too far.
