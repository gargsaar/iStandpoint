Imagined the summary of my to be written autobiography.



---------

The dream I saw a few years ago has become a reality. I'm holding my autobiography in my hand. It’s like holding a baby. Today, I've become a father again. A very proud one.

Every word of it has come straight from my heart and reflects me, including the title, 'A Nice Guy Who Didn’t Finish Last'. My autobiography has my life journey divided into three parts. 

Part One has stories from my childhood. This part begins with a story about how I came into this world and it became a Breaking News!

William Shakespeare said “All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances.”                                       

I made my entry in this world once upon a time. I was the first boy of my generation. My grandma was extremely happy with the news of my birth. She was so excited that she ran with all enthusiasm to see me in the hospital room. She was a strong woman. She pushed the door of the room with full power without realising that Dr. Kirti Vyas, my gynecologist, was standing behind the door. Dr. Kirti was a thin and elegant young lady. Frightened with grandma’s sudden attack, she fell flat on the ground. She broke her nose. Unfortunate for her, but the news of my birth became a breaking news!

Part Two is all about my youth. You will get to read amazing stories about a Nice Guy, who finished last, but won. Also, the reason behind the title.

I was very popular in college. I used to give support, do favours, do everything consistent with the general meaning of the term nice. In-fact, I was so nice that I never took any advantage of a drunken female friend while escorting her back from parties to her bed, no matter how much she insisted. I was the perfect boyfriend material who never ended up being a boyfriend. 

For all the nice guys out there and ladies who are single, I want say that nice guys may not end up being boyfriends, but trust me, they are very good husband material.

Part Three talks about my struggles and glory. It narrates how I shaped my life to make it immortal. What I did so that my memories remained. 

I'm sure this book will be an inspiration for those who think they are fortunate to have a life in which they can see, hear and speak. The book is for those want to make their life count.
