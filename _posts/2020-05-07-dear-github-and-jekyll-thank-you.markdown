Dear [Github](https://github.com/about), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and [Netlify](https://www.netlifycms.org/):

Thank you for giving us [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a great platform where we can build our website/ blog and host it using custom domain for free using Jekyll 



Setting up a website was an easy 3 steps process: create a public repository in Github, download a Jekyll theme/ template and upload it into the repository, and configure the Netlify, an open source content management platform for Github.



I always wanted to not pay for hosting my website. I tried various options such as [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/pricing/) where you can use your custom domain by paying around $3 per month, or [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/in/pricing) at $5 per month, or [Wix](https://www.wix.com/upgrade/website) at around 50 cents per month. And apart from shelling out anything from the pocket, I wanted a complete ownership of the code.

Then as always, Github came to me
