Dear [Github](https://github.com/about), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and [Netlify](https://www.netlifycms.org/):

Thank you for giving us [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a great platform where we can host websites using custom domain for free. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), you are awesome!,  your markdown file based themes are not only lightweight, but also database independent that makes it super easy to configure and manage static websites. And last but not the least, thank you [Netlify](https://www.netlifycms.org/), for making your content management system Open source where we can manage the content using an easy to use user interface.  

Setting up my blog, [iStandpoint](https://sarthakgarg.com/), was an easy 3 steps process. 

1. Created a public repository in Github.
2. Downloaded a Jekyll theme and upload it in the Git repository.
3. Configure Netlify to deploy your site from Git, and off you go!

It's not that [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/), [Wix](https://www.wix.com/), or [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/in) are not great for building websites, it's just that they are not free (you need to pay for using your custom domain), and 

So why to pay a penny for hosting your website when you can do it for free, and that too with the best.
