**Dear** [Github](https://github.com/about), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and [Netlify](https://www.netlifycms.org/):

Thank you for giving us [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a great platform where we can host websites using custom domain for free. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), you are awesome!,  your markdown file based themes are not only lightweight, but also database independent that makes it super easy to configure and manage static websites. And last but not the least, thank you [Netlify](https://www.netlifycms.org/), for making your content management system Open source where we can manage the content using an easy-to-use user interface.  

Setting up my blog, [iStandpoint](https://sarthakgarg.com/), was an easy 3 step process: **Create > Upload > Deploy**

**CREATE** A PUBLIC REPO IN GITHUB

**UPLOAD** A JEKYLL THEME IN THE GIT REPO

**DEPLOY** GIT REPO IN NETLIFY AND CONFIGURE

It's not that [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/), [Wix](https://www.wix.com/), or [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/in) are not great for building websites, it's just that, one:  they are not free (need to pay for using custom domain), two: they are not as fast and secure, and most importantly: you don't feel like you own the website code.  So why to pay a penny for hosting websites elsewhere when we can do it for free and that too with the best.

**Warm Regards,**
