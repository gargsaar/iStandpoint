**Dear** [Github](https://github.com/about), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and [Netlify](https://www.netlifycms.org/):

If you search, you can find God. Searching for 'how to host a website for free' was far too easy, and it was because you all exist. So, thank you!

Thank you for giving us [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a great platform where we can host websites using custom domain for free. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), you are awesome!,  your markdown file based themes are not only lightweight, but also database independent that makes it super easy to configure and manage static websites. And last but not the least, [Netlify](https://www.netlifycms.org/), without you content management would have been a nightmare, your Open Source Content Management System with an easy-to-use user interface is simply the best.  

Setting up my blog, [iStandpoint](https://sarthakgarg.com/), was an easy 3 step process: **Create, Upload, Deploy**

**CREATE** A PUBLIC REPO IN GITHUB

The excellent documentation on the [Github Help](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) helped me well in getting started. I created the [iStandpoint](https://github.com/gargsaar/iStandpoint) repository which now host [my](https://sarthakgarg.com/) blog, made it public so that I can host my site on Github for free, and used the custom domain bought at [godaddy.com](https://www.godaddy.com/), my preferred domain name provider because they make domain management so easy. 

**UPLOAD** A JEKYLL THEME AND CONFIGURE

On the settings page, in the **GitHub Pages** section, there is an option to **Choose a theme**, but frankly, there are a countless other [themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) that are much better. So I choose to use a theme by [Thiago Rossener](https://rossener.com/). I downloaded [Jeklix-template](https://github.com/thiagorossener/jekflix-template) and uploaded all the files in my repository. Next, all I had to do was - edit a few file it to make the theme personal.

I started with **_config.yml** where I updated the #Site Settings, updated [disqus_usename](https://disqus.com/), removed a few items under #Social Media Settings, and updated the [google_analytics](https://analytics.withgoogle.com/) id. Followed by **CNAME** file where I added my custom domain name**.** Created a [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) file for myself in the folder **_authors.** Changed favicon and other icons at assets/img/icons, and blog_image.png at assets/img.

**DEPLOY** SITE IN NETLIFY,  AND OFF YOU GO

It's not that [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/), [Wix](https://www.wix.com/), or [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/in) are not great for building websites, it's just that, one:  they are not free (need to pay for using custom domain), two: they are not as fast and secure, and most importantly: you don't feel like you own the website code.  So why to pay a penny for hosting websites elsewhere when we can do it for free and that too with the best.



**Warm Regards,**
