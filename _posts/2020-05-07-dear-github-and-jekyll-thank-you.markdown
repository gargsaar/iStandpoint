Dear [Github](https://github.com/about), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and [Netlify](https://www.netlifycms.org/):

Thank you for giving us [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a great platform where we can host websites using custom domain for free. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) provides markdown based themes that are lightweight and do not require any database to build static websites. And last but not the least, thank you [Netlify](https://www.netlifycms.org/), for making your content management system Open source where we can manage content using an easy-to-use user interface.  

Setting up my blog, [iStandpoint](https://sarthakgarg.com/), was an easy 3 steps process. 

1. Created a public repository in Github,
2. Downloaded the Netflix Jekyll theme and upload it into the repository
3. Configured the Netlify account to manage my git repository

It's not that [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/), [Wix](https://www.wix.com/), or [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/in) are not great. These website building platforms are awesome, but they come with a fee, and why to pay a penny for hosting your website when you can do it for free.
