**Dear** [Github](https://github.com/about), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and [Netlify](https://www.netlifycms.org/):

Thank you for giving us [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a great platform where we can host websites using custom domain for free. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), you are awesome!,  your markdown file based themes are not only lightweight, but also database independent that makes it super easy to configure and manage static websites. And last but not the least, thank you [Netlify](https://www.netlifycms.org/), for making your content management system Open source where we can manage the content using an easy-to-use user interface.  

Setting up my blog, [iStandpoint](https://sarthakgarg.com/), was an easy 3 step process: **Create, Upload, Deploy**

**CREATE** A PUBLIC REPO IN GITHUB

The excellent documentation on the [Github Help](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) and [Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) helped me well in getting started and I created the [iStandpoint](https://github.com/gargsaar/iStandpoint) repository which now host [my](https://sarthakgarg.com/) blog. 

**UPLOAD** A JEKYLL THEME AND CONFIGURE

On the settings page, in the **GitHub Pages** section, there is an option to **Choose a theme**, but frankly, there are a countless other [themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) that are much better. So I choose to use a theme by [Thiago Rossener](https://rossener.com/). I downloaded [Jeklix-template](https://github.com/thiagorossener/jekflix-template) and uploaded all the files in my repository. Next, all I had to do was - edit a few file it to make the theme personal.

I started with **_config.yml** where I updated the #Site Settings, removed a few items under #Social Media Settings, and updated the [google_analytics](https://analytics.withgoogle.com/) id.

**DEPLOY** SITE IN NETLIFY,  AND OFF YOU GO

It's not that [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/), [Wix](https://www.wix.com/), or [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/in) are not great for building websites, it's just that, one:  they are not free (need to pay for using custom domain), two: they are not as fast and secure, and most importantly: you don't feel like you own the website code.  So why to pay a penny for hosting websites elsewhere when we can do it for free and that too with the best.

**Warm Regards,**
