One day while reading about different styles of leaderships, I got to know there is something called 'Paternalistic' style of leadership.

In our lives we often come across people who do a lot for us, but we don't realise. Talking about myself, my wife is one such person in my life. She is somebody who is the go-to person in our family for getting things done, moral and emotional support, and all kinds of advices. She is a true example of a Parent Leader following the Paternalistic Leadership style.  

She leads as if she is the parent in the family. She exhibits controlling and caring attitude at the same time. Her aim is to offer guidance and protection to her loved ones, and in exchange, all she wants is loyalty and respect. Her style is not simply authoritarian, but authority with a long-term vested interest in all the members at play. 

This style of leadership is pretty common where the culture is very hierarchical and group oriented, in regions such as Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, or you can say about 67% of the world’s population.

*Some of the characterstics of a parent leader are:*

A Parent Leader leads the organization/team like they are a family. For example, if you are hosting a housewarming party, they are surely going to show up. They hate feeling of left out and there is nothing worse when they are not involved.

They values loyalty above all other characteristics. They would prefer someone who, when the ship starts to sink, will tie themselves to the mast as compared to hotshots who come in and think they are great but are ready to jump ship for a better offer. For them nothing will destroy the trust faster than any attempt that smells of disloyalty.

They makes decisions based on intuition and prefers things to be done “their way”. For them, the past is often frozen in a beautiful, perfect (or at least good-enough) picture and places an extremely high value on “the way we used to do it/always have done it”. The phrase “just trust me” is often used as a way to end discussions.

A Parent Leader delegates duties, but not authority. They hold the final authority and while they will expect others to do their part.

*Sound like someone you know?*

I think anyone can be a parent leader, e.g, you, your mother, father, close friend, younger brother or sister, teacher,..., anybody. If the purpose of your life is to live for your family, you are a parent leader. People usually fail not because of the circumstances or the lack of a better approach. More often than not they fail because they don’t have the right leader to carry them through the thick and thin while achieving their dreams. Parent leaders, like my wife, are those who burn themselves to let others go that extra mile.
