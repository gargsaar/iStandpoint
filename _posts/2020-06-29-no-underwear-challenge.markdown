An intricate characteristic of we, humans, in general is that we don’t value things we easily get, so we never give them any respect. For example, our underwear. Have you ever thought how important an underwear is in our lives. It may occur to you that an underwear is just a piece of cloth, but pause for a moment and imagine your lives without an underwear. 

Impossible!

And how often you think about the pain and atrocities from which an underwear has to suffer? An underwear is one of those innocent objects in our lives without which we can't live, but we never give a damn. 

Rewind your life and go back to the moment when you brought home a brand new underwear. When you took out the brand new underwear of the packet, it was so fresh, full of energy. But what we, humans, did to it. Poor underwear didn't even know where it will get into. 

It enters there and the suffering begins. Terribly fatal bacterias, deadly microbes, horrifying odour, suffocated hairy surroundings, astronomic jolt of farts, it undergoes every inhumane cruelty possible. In-fact, it lives with relentless negativity all the time, and some of us don’t even change it everyday. 

Insane!

This happens to the innocent underwear for years. An underwear which was initially conserving momentum because of the energy, after a few years, becomes powerless. It looses charm and gets holes in it. But we, humans, still don’t stop. We continue the brutality by using it as a mop or a dust cleaner failing to understand that it can’t shout on its own to say that give me some respect. And we keep on doing this because we know that it can't fight for itself.

The reality is that it is because of an underwear our lives are so comfortable. Even if comfort is not enough to give it the due respect, think about hygiene. It’s because of an underwear that we remain healthy. An underwear is that unrecognised saviour who absorbs our horrendous bodily excretions, so that we can keep safe. It is that unsung hero who protects our outer garments from being spoiled or spotted, so that we don’t feel embarrassed.

Introspect!

Like this poor underwear, everything else we get in our lives, living or non-living, deserve some respect. We are fortunate to have these things, so the very least we can do is realise their value and treat them with respect. Because once they are gone, it is us who will suffer, and not them. Poor us, we will not even know where we will get into.
