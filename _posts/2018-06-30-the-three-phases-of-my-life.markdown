In 17th century in the UK, during winter, the sea water often freezes. So, before a ship could travel down to the trading port, a special ship called "Ice Breaker" went into the iced water to literally break the ice. Hence the ice breaker was needed for them to get down to business. 

Today, I'll break my fear of expressing myself with my first blog post that will tell you the story of my life.

My life has been divided into 3 parts. I call them “The three phases of my life”.

*Phase 1 – I call it “Breaking News”*

William Shakespeare said “All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances;” 

I made my entry in this world once upon a time. I was born in a city about 60 kms from Delhi. I was the first boy of my generation, so my grandma was extremely happy with the news of my birth. She was so excited that she ran with all enthusiasm to see me in the hospital room. Without realsing that somebody may be standing behind the door, she pushed it with full power. My gynecologist who was standing next to the door got frightened with grandma’s sudden push of the door. She fell on the ground and broke her nose. So the news of my birth became a breaking news!

I was a chubby and cute baby. My uncle had a factory for manufacturing bedsheets and wanted me to model for his products. But my superstitious grandma refused fearing an evil eye. So my modeling career was aborted and I missed the chance of being well known. Many years later, I did get a chance again and I grabbed it. I am doing modeling for 3 years now. I can see some disbelieving thoughts. Well actually in my job I build predictive models using Machine Learning & AI.

*Phase 2 – I call it “Nice Guy”*

I did my MBA from Great Lakes Institute of Management, Chennai. I was very popular in my college. I was a typical "nice guy" who used to put the needs of others before his own, do favors, give emotional support, and generally act in a way consistent with the general meaning of "nice". I was one of those guys who escort their drunken female friends back from parties and never take advantage once they’re at her door, guys who are accredited as boyfriend material but somehow don’t end up being boyfriends.

So by the virtue of being a nice guy, I ended up doing arrange marriage as opposed to my desire of first falling in love and then marrying. Fortunately, today, I am a happily married man. 

For all the nice guys out there and ladies who are single, I can say that nice guys are not only good friends, but also good husband.

*Last and the current Phase – I call it “Keep Walking”*

I am one of those who is mortally afraid of Death. There are a couple of reasons that makes death so terrifying. Like what will happen to my loved ones when I am gone? But the thought that scares the shit of me is - have I done enough that I can die today? Theis thought bring a sense of urgency in my life and provide me a whole purpose of living. 

I don’t have a Mercedes, but the very fact that I can see, hear, & speak makes me feel fortunate when I think of those who can’t. I have a fortunate life, but just one life.

I believe that I need to live it and make make it count. Do everything I want to do. Make it immortal by doing something that my memory remains. And for that I need to keep walking!

Before winding up I want say a few lines: 

*You know my name, and my story,*

*my fancies and my shining glory,*

*You know what I’ve done, and what I’ve been through,*

*life has been beautiful so far,*

*What next it will bring, nobody has a clue!!*
