In 17th century in the UK, during winter, the sea water often freezes. So, before a ship could travel down to the trading port, a special ship called "Ice Breaker" went into the iced water to literally break the ice. Hence an ice breaker was needed for them to get down to business. Today, I'll break the ice to devel in to the frozen history of my life . 

My life has been divided into 3 parts. I call them “The three phases of my life”.

*Phase 1 – I call it “Breaking News”*

William Shakespeare said “All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances;” 

I made my entry in this world once upon a time. I was born in a city about 60 kms from Delhi. I was the first boy of my generation, so my grandma was extremely happy with the news of my birth. She was so excited that she ran with all enthusiasm to see me in the hospital room. She pushed the door of the room with full power without realising that, Ms Myra, my gynecologist was standing just behind the door. Ms Myra was a thin and elegant young lady. Frightened with grandma’s sudden attack on her, she fell flat on the ground. She broke her nose and the news of my birth became a breaking news!

*Phase 2 – I call it “Nice Guy”*

I was very popular in my college. I was a very nice guy. I used to give support, do favors, and do all the nice things. Infact, I was so nice that I never took advantage of heavy drunken female friends while escorting them back from parties to their hostel room, no matter how much they insisted. I was the perfect boyfriend material who never ended up being a boyfriend. 

So by the virtue of being nice, I ended up doing arrange marriage as opposed to my desire of first falling in love and then marrying. Fortunately, today, I am a happily married man. For all the nice guys out there and ladies who are single, I want say that being nice is not always bad. Nice guys may not end up being boyfriend, but trust me, they are very good husband.

*Last and the current Phase – I call it “Keep Walking”*

I am one of those who is mortally afraid of death. There are a couple of reasons that makes death so terrifying. Like what will happen to my loved ones when I am gone. But the thought that scares the shit out of me is - have I done enough that I can die today? This thought bring a sense of urgency in my life and provide me a purpose. 

I don’t have a Mercedes, but the very fact that I can see, hear, & speak makes me feel fortunate when I think of those who can’t. I have a fortunate life, but just one life, so I have to make it count. Do everything I want to do. Make it immortal by doing something that my memory remains. And for that I need to keep walking!

Before winding up I want say a few lines: 

*You know my name, and my story,*

*my fancies and my shining glory,*

*You know what I’ve done, and what I’ve been through,*

*life has been beautiful so far,*

*What next it will bring, nobody has a clue!!*
