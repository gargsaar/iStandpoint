title:  "The Three Phases Of My Life"

In 17th century in the UK, during winter, the sea water often freezes. So, before a ship could travel down to the trading port, a special ship called "Ice Breaker" went into the iced water to literally break the ice. Hence an ice breaker was needed for them to get down to business. Today, I'll break my ice with this first blog post. 

My life has been divided into 3 parts. I call them “The three phases of my life”.

*Phase 1 – I call it “Breaking News”*

William Shakespeare said “All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances;” 

I made my entry in this world once upon a time. I was born in a city about 60 kms from Delhi. I was the first boy of my generation, so my grandma was extremely happy with the news of my birth. She was so excited that she ran with all enthusiasm to see me in the hospital room. She pushed the door of the room with full power without realising that my gynecologist was standing just behind it. Gyne was a slim trim, young lady. She got frightened with grandma’s sudden attack on her and fell on the ground. She broke her nose, and the news of my birth became a breaking news!

*Phase 2 – I call it “Nice Guy”*

I was very popular in my college. I was a very "nice guy". I used to give emotional support, do favors, etc, etc. I was one of those guys who used to escort drunken female friends back from parties, but never take advantage. I was a perfect boyfriend material, but somehow never ended up being a boyfriend.So by the virtue of being a nice guy, I ended up doing arrange marriage as opposed to my desire of first falling in love and then marrying. Fortunately, today, I am a happily married man. 

For all the nice guys out there and ladies who are single, I can say that nice guys are not only good friends, but also very good husband.

*Last and the current Phase – I call it “Keep Walking”*

I am one of those who is mortally afraid of death. There are a couple of reasons that makes death so terrifying. Like what will happen to my loved ones when I am gone. But the thought that scares the shit of me is - have I done enough that I can die today? This thought bring a sense of urgency in my life and provide me a purpose. 

I don’t have a Mercedes, but the very fact that I can see, hear, & speak makes me feel fortunate when I think of those who can’t. I have a fortunate life, but just one life. I believe that I need to make my life count. Do everything I want to do. Make it immortal by doing something that my memory remains. And for that I need to keep walking!

Before winding up I want say a few lines: 

*You know my name, and my story,*

*my fancies and my shining glory,*

*You know what I’ve done, and what I’ve been through,*

*life has been beautiful so far,*

*What next it will bring, nobody has a clue!!*
