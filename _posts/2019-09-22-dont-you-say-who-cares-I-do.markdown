It was a usual summer morning, sky was bright and clear. Appa was at the breakfast table, precisely at seven. I joined late, exactly after 5 minutes. Appa turned, startled, to find a large cauliflower-shaped lady, his wife, loomed over him to put a Palappam in his plate. I liked chicken curry, but who cared what I liked.

By the time I started, Appa was done. I wanted to have one more, but he’d not wait. Amma, who stood close-by, had a steel glass in her hand, filled with filter coffee. She looked at me. I thought she would throw the glass on his head. To my disappointment, she did nothing. I wished she had the courage to at-least think about it. I had the courage, but I kept silent as I didn’t want to walk for 4 kilometres. 

Appa took the same route every day. I knew the shortcut, but who cared what I knew. He didn’t like me. Maybe, he was upset with what I did to him. 

I was the first girl in my family after eight cousin brothers, so Achamma was extremely happy with the news of my birth. She was so excited to see me that she ran towards the hospital room with all enthusiasm. She was a strong woman. She banged the door with full power. Appa, who was standing behind the door, fell flat on the ground, thrashed by Achamma’s sudden attack. He broke his nose, and the news of my birth became a breaking news for him, literally. From a distance his nose looked ok, but up close it was bent towards a side. I thought, he must be happy with his peculiar nose that made him famous, but who cared what I thought.

Scooter stopped at Kendriya Vidhayala, and in a moment, disappeared. I noticed a coin on the road. A kind that I had never seen before. It was old, shiny, engraved a sword on one side, and on the other, something that I couldn’t decipher. I didn’t look left or right, just picked it up.

The evening turned dull, and overcast. I reached home to find Amma sitting silently in a corner, staring at Appa without the drop of a blink. Appa had unsettled the house. Cushions on the floor, carpet upside down, chairs on the table. Amma tried to inquire a couple of times, but all in vain. She knew the answer won’t come easily, so she tried again.

“What are you searching?” 

“A coin,” he replied in a hope.

“What coin?”

He didn’t reply as he sensed that she knew nothing about it. 

But I knew. I couldn’t believe it was his. For a person who had never stepped out of Kollam, how did he get the coin? And, why was the coin so special? 

Life is uncertain, apt to spring a nasty surprise when you least expect it. For the first time in my life I had something that he wanted. I was in seventh heaven. Finally, the time had come to take revenge. “Swear to all the Palappam I couldn’t eat, I’ll never give it to him”, I muttered.

Appa behaved as if he was in hell, disturbed. He yelled at Amma for the fifth time. She never said anything to him. Her strength was her weakness. But this time, she had lost the strength to be patient anymore.

Furiously, she shouted, "Who will put the things back in order, your father?"

He ran towards Amma with a rage in his eyes. Appa is a dark, tall man, a little over middle age, but strong. I never saw him so angry before. I stood up to protect Amma. I opened my fist to show the coin, but I didn’t give. The anger inside him burst into a fury. Then something happened that had never happened. His hand hit my cheek. It sneezed red liquid out from my nose. I still didn’t give. Stung by humiliation, he pushed me to the floor. Terrified by the next thing that could have happened, I threw the coin in front of him. He picked it up and walked away.

I sat on the floor with my eyes closed. I felt miserable as if someone had spit on me. A thunderstorm struck inside me, and outside, it started raining heavily. I couldn’t believe he drew the blood out of his blood, just for a coin. 

The night got dark, but I was still awake. Suddenly, the door of my room opened. I expected Amma, but it was him. He came in and sat next to me.

“I know how it feels when you don’t know from where you will get your next meal. Your grandpa gave me this coin on his deathbed. He got it from a merchant who believed it can change things, and so it did, like a magic. I’ve slaved for years committed to an unvarying routine. My days merged into one indistinguishable blur of eating, sleeping, and getting up, for the only purpose - to give you a life. This coin brought us luck, and since then, it’s always there with me.” A bleak smile appeared on his face as he remembered his father.

“When I lost the coin, I got scared that the magic will vanish. No matter how ugly the past was, it may return, and this is not what you wish. The very things that make you happy – are also the cause of unhappiness, because the moment these underpinnings are taken away, your happiness crumbles and you cannot help sinking into sorrow.” He lowered his face, and paused for a moment.

After a while, he resumed with an unprecedented confidence in his voice.

“All my life, I’ve continually lived in an urge to earn and grow, without realizing what will I do with this life - without you. In this world where everything perishes, I forgot that I can get imperishable happiness in just one thing, you, my love. The thought of losing you scared me so much that I’m not scared of anything now.” His eyes got wet.

He took my hand, placed the coin on my palm, and closed the fingers. “This is the only thing I have of my father. It's very close to my heart and will always be. Take care of it. What I did, can’t be changed, but what we can change is - our future.” He kissed me on the forehead, and left the room.

I collapsed into my bed, sobbing, thinking, I was so wrong. Unanticipated tears rolled down my eyes. Love is a feeling that has no standard language and every person has its own way of reflection. That moment, I felt love. Sooner when the emotional impulse receded, the past tried to dominate the present. It itched the agonies of his deeds. But I had the option to forgive the evil to accept the good, and I chose to forgive.

I was wrong that who cares. He does. Through tears, I grasped the hard truth that despair can disappear in an instant. I felt an eternal happiness that I hope will not wear thin or fade away.
