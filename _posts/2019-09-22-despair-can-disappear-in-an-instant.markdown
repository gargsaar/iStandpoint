Appa disappeared. His body was lying in front of me on the hospital bed. Through tears I recalled the hard truth that he had taught me, "despair will disappear soon," like it had 30 years ago when I was 7 years old.

It was a usual Monday morning, sky was clear, and Appa at the breakfast table, precisely at seven.

Appa was a quiet man who lives in his own world that starts and ends with ‘Coco Exports’. A simple business to export coconuts outside Kerela. Appa enjoyed his prosperity with considerable pride. He always said, “This wealth hasn’t struck suddenly like a visitation, but instead grown it gradually like a tree. I have ploughed it with my sweat.”

I was late by 5 minutes. He continued eating without looking at me. I turned, startled, to find a large cauliflower-shaped lady, Amma, loomed over me to put a Palappam in my plate. I looked at her with the ugliest face possible, and shouted with my eyes, "Palappam, not again!"

I wondered why Appa was so obsessed with Palappam. He ate Palappam – night and day. I closed my eyes to ask Achamma, my deceased grandma who was enjoying chicken in heaven, “Why?” Even she didn’t know why Appa was so content. I liked chicken, but who cared what I liked.

By the time I was about to finish the first Palappam, Appa was done. I wanted to have one more, but he’d not wait. I hated Appa. He never cared what I wanted. He didn't love me. 

I looked at Amma who stood close-by. She had a steel glass in her hand, filled with filter coffee. I wanted her to throw the glass on Appa’s head to break it into two. His head, not the glass. She did nothing. I wished she had the courage to at-least think about it. By the virtue of attaining adulthood next year, I had the courage, but I kept silent for two reasons.

First, I didn’t want to walk for 4 kilometres as I wanted to conserve energy for the dance competition. Second, I didn't want to miss the ride as it was the only time when I learned how he drives Activa, our scooter, and his only thing I was interested in. 

Appa took the same route every day. I knew the shortcut that could have saved us from the scorching heat, but who cared what I knew. He didn’t like me. Maybe, he was upset with what I did to him. 

I was the first girl in my family after eight cousin brothers. Achamma was extremely happy with the news of my birth. She was so excited to see me that she ran towards the hospital room with all enthusiasm. She was a strong woman. She banged the door with full power. Appa, who was standing behind the door, fell flat on the ground, thrashed by Achamma’s sudden attack. He broke his nose, and the news of my birth became a breaking news for him, literally. From a distance his nose looked ok, but up close it was bent towards a side. I thought, he must be happy with his peculiar nose that made him famous, but who cared what I thought.

Lost in his nose, I didn’t realise we reached Gate 4, Kendriya Vidhayala. Activa stopped, and in a moment, disappeared. I hoped he would  wish me for the dance competition, but I knew it was a half-hearted hope.

Just a step further, I realised there was a pen on the road. I turned to look at it. It was a kind that I had never seen before. A old, but shiny pen that engraved a sword on it's body, and on the cap, something that I couldn’t decipher. I didn’t look left or right, just picked it up.

The evening turned dull, and overcast. I reached home to find Amma sitting silently in a corner, staring at Appa without the drop of an eyelash. I pulled a chair and sat next to Amma. 

“How was the competition?” she asked without moving her head. 

“We lost!” I said, casually. 

“Then why are you not sad?” she stared at me, bamboozled. 

“Why is Appa sherlock?” I asked in an attempt to change the topic.

“Only God knows, why he has come so early today, and what he is doing.” 

Appa had unsettled the house. Cushions on the floor, carpet upside down, chairs on the table. Amma tried to inquire a couple of times, but all in vain. She knew the answer won’t come easily, so she tried again.

“What are you searching?” 

“A pen.”

“What pen?”

“A pen with a sword.”

“What?”

He looked at Amma as if he will bite her with his eyes, but didn’t say anything. He knew that she knew nothing about it. 

But I knew. I couldn’t believe it was his. For a person who had never stepped out of Kollam, how did he get the pen? And, why was the pen so special? 

I wanted the answers, so I closed my eyes. We couldn’t connect. Maybe, Achamma was busy holidaying on a beach, not reachable.

“Life is uncertain, apt to spring a nasty surprise when you least expect it.” I thought with a nasty smile. For the first time in my life I had something that he wanted. I was in seventh heaven. Finally, the time had come to take revenge. “Swear to all the Palappam I couldn’t eat, I’ll never give it to him,” I muttered.

Appa behaved as if he was in hell, disturbed. He yelled at Amma for the fifth time. She never said anything to him. Her strength was her weakness. But this time, she had lost the strength to be patient anymore.

Furiously, she shouted, "Who will put the things back in order, your father?"

He ran towards Amma with a rage in his eyes. He was a dark, tall man, a little over middle age, but strong. I never saw him so angry before. I stood up to protect Amma. I showed the pen, but didn’t give. The anger inside him burst into a fury. Then something happened that had never happened. His hand hit my cheek. It sneezed red liquid out from my nose. Still, I didn’t give. Stung by humiliation, he pushed me to the floor. Terrified by the next thing that could have happened, I threw it in front of him. He picked it up and walked away.

I sat on the floor with my eyes closed. I felt miserable as if someone had spit on me. A thunderstorm struck inside me, and outside, it started raining heavily. I couldn’t believe he drew the blood out of his blood for a pen. 

The night got dark, but I was awake. Suddenly, the door of my room opened. I expected Amma, but it was him.

He came in and sat next to me. And said, “I know how it feels when you don’t know from where you will get your next meal.” 

He took the pen out from his pocket and put it in his hand.

“Appa gave me this pen on his deathbed. He got it from his father who believed this pen is magical and brought him the fortune.” A sadness appeared on his face as he remembered his father.

In a low voice he said, “When I lost it, I got scared that the magic will vanish. And the very things that makes you happy, like this pen, are also the cause of unhappiness. Because the moment these underpinnings are taken away, your happiness crumbles and you cannot help sinking into sorrow.”

He lowered his face and paused for a moment. After a while, he resumed with an unprecedented confidence in his voice.

“All my life, I thought the magic is in the pen without realising the magic is in us. And what will I do  if I don't have you. What I did today, can’t be changed. But what I can change is - tomorrow.”

He took my hand and placed it on my palm. 

“This is the only thing I have of Appa. Take care of it.” 

He kissed me on the forehead, and left the room.

I collapsed on my bed, sobbing, thinking, I was so wrong. Unanticipated tears rolled down my eyes. 

“Love is a feeling that has no standard language and every person has its own way of reflection.” I thought. For the first time, I felt love. Sooner, when the emotional impulse receded, the past tried to dominate the present. It itched the agonies of his deeds. But I had the option to forgive the evil to accept the good, and I chose to forgive.

I was wrong that who cares. He does. I felt an eternal happiness that I hope will not wear thin or fade away. Through tears, I learned the hard truth - 'despair can disappear in an instant', and I smiled.
