Wikipedia says, a blind date is a social engagement between two people who have not previously met, usually arranged by a mutual acquaintance. 

The mutual acquaintance in my case was Vijay uncle, formally known as Mr. Vijay Makhani. He was an engineering by qualification and a matchmaker by profession. Why he left his engineering job to be a matchmaker was a mystery. Maybe he took Queen Elizabeth a little too seriously who once said, "at its heart, engineering is about using science to find creative and practical solutions." And he did exactly that. People said he had developed some kind of algorithm to analyse people and match profiles. No wonder, why he had an unprecedented record of successful marriages.

For him, I was a prospect. I think his algorithm assessed the state of my mind. A frustrated young lad, in the second year of job, looking for a change in his life. I was not enjoying my job. All it required was using the left side of the brain. No creativity. In-fact, I never liked engineering. 

When art students were being taught about romance, love which they used in their lives; we, engineers, were taught about chemical bonding. And that too in a class where the only girl was not willing to look at us. How were we suppose to understand the concept of bonding. On one hand the lucky oxygen atom was involved in a twosome with two hydrogen atoms, and I struggled to find even a single girl. As a matter of fact, I was so single that if my friends were asked about an example for a singular noun, they would say 'Aditya Shaurya'. 

On a bright Saturday morning, Vijay uncle came to our house. He sat next to my dad on the Chesterfield sofa, a signature object in our luxury living room. 

In his gentle voice, he asked, "Aditya, do you work with Acme Engineering." 

Uninterested, I replied, "Yes, Uncle." 

Eying an opportuity, he said, "Why don't you meet Myra. She also works there."

"Sure", was my reply with a smile.

The meeting got fixed for tomorrow, at her house. 

The entire night I was on Facebook and Instagram. Her curly hair, blue eyes, mulberry silk like skin, and perfectly chiselled body with enticing curves didn’t allow my mind to take my eyes off her. My frustrated heart started beating again as if it got an elixir of life. You know a thing about singular nouns, they fall in love instantly. I too was in love. 

Next day we reached her house on time. I like this thing about modern families - they are very open minded. My parents stayed back in an equally luxurious living room and I was asked to go up to her room.

With every stair the love inside me grew. I imagined us togethert. My imagination itched my desires and an unusual electric current floated in my body. I couldn’t wait to be with her.

I entered her room. The room had colorful walls nicely decorated with family photos. A bright sunlight pierced through the floral curtains which along with a pleasant aroma was just enough to upbeat the mood.

To my surprise, she was not alone. She was with Riya, her best friend, and my school mate who had a crush on me.

I had the best blind date possible. It was a date with just not one, but two beautiful girls. One who liked me and the other whom I liked.
