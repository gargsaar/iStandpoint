**Day-22.** Everyone's elated, the wait is over! We're are going back to our normal lives, leaving behind the masks, sanitisers, work from home chores, and anxiety to maintain extreme personal hygiene because hey! we’ve won the battle, we've defeated the virus.

The moment is to celebrate the victory of a 21 days long, well-fought battle won with sheer determination and perseverance. The moment is to celebrate the break-free. 

Half the country is on the streets, out of their homes with the national flags, playing patriotic songs, and shouting slogans praising the government, doctors, healthcare staff and other workers assuming that we've completely eradicated the virus, we stayed home for 21 days, now let's move on. It's a much bigger celebration than the Janta curfew clapping episode. 

Public places, malls, restaurants, movie halls, parks are flooded with people. Everybody is carefree and enjoying, no need of social distancing. Offices are back to their normal ways of working amassing people in concentration camps all in for a five-alarm fire. Daily wage workers are running to the city in a hope to earn back a little of what they’ve lost, piled into trains and buses optimistic that not even a single person of the thousands has the virus.

**Celebrate, why not...**

<Stats on Governments', health care staff and workers, general population effort in handling the situation>

**No, don't. Why not...**

There are high chances of a second wave of the virus spreading like wild fire into the country. It had happened with N1H1 virus in 2009. As soon as it was contained and people went back to their normal lives, there was a second wave.

**What to do..**

21 days of Quarantine will be absolutely useless unless we educate the people about what to do on Day-22, otherwise the lock-down will come again, strict and for long. 

Act wisely and use our common sense by doing the most basic things; don’t go partying on day 22; try to follow all the instructions you did for the last 4 weeks to the maximum extent; please don’t forget, this is not the end of the virus, this is only the beginning of the end. Educate and spread awareness about the after effects to people who do not have access to resources and information by sharing this article.

Use this as an official petition urging the government to take into consideration the above points before announcing any further instructions after the lock down is over. Persuade the government to let the lock-down downsize in separate stages. Say for another week only the essential services shall be open like banks, grocery stores and the frequency of public transportation shall be minimal. In the next week the frequency can be increased after monitoring the effects of the spread and the public shall be urged to avoid assembling in large numbers and practice social distancing. All public places like theaters, malls, parks shall be the last priority to be open for the public.

If we genuinely understand the seriousness of the issue and come together as a single voice in these times of crisis, we can make a huge difference in the lives of 1.3 billion Indians. I’m just a regular kid who’s paranoid about the virus and who really wants to make a difference.

Do any of us want another lock-down? I definitely don't.
