An intricate characteristic of humans in general is that we don't value things we get easily. For example, our underwear. Have you ever thought how important an underwear is in our lives. It may occur to you that an underwear is just a piece of cloth, but pause for a moment and imagine your lives without an underwear. 

It is because of an underwear your lives are so comfortable. Even if comfort is not enough to give it the due respect, then think about hygiene. It's because of an underwear that you remain healthy. An underwear is that unrecognised saviour who absorbs your horrendous bodily excretions, so that it can keep you safe. And it protects your outer garments from being spoiled or spotted, so that you don't feel embarrassed.

And how often you think about the pain and atrocities from which an underwear has to suffer. 

I think an underwear is the most innocent object we come across in our lives. Imagine a brand new underwear out of the packet. It is so fresh, full of energy. But look at the innocence. This new underwear, it doesn't even know where it will get into. 

It enters there and the suffering begins. Terribly fatal bacterias, deadly microbes, horrifying odour, suffocated hairy surroundings, astronomic jolt of farts, it undergoes every inhumane cruelty possible. Infact, it lives with relentless negativity all the time. And some insane humans don't even change it everyday.    

This happens to an underwear for years. An underwear which was initially conserving momentum because of the energy, after few years, becomes powerless. It looses charm and gets holes in it. But we humans still don't stop. 

We continue the brutality by using it as a mop or a dust cleaner because we don't feel. We don't understand that it can't fight for itself. It can't cry to make you realise that it too has an expiry.
