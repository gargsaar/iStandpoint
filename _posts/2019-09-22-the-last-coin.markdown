There was nothing unusual about that morning. The day began with Baba and I seated at the only table in our house, waiting for parathas, an Indian bread filled with onion. Baba was obsessed with paratha. I wondered why he ate only parathas –  night and day. I closed my eyes to ask Dadi, my deceased grandma who was enjoying chicken in the breakfast at heaven, "Why?" Even she didn’t know why Baba was so content. I liked chicken, but who cared what I liked.

Baba turned, startled, to find a large cauliflower-shaped lady, his wife, loomed over him to feed him the fourth paratha. Maa was happy doing the same thing for fifteen years now. By the time Baba was done, I had finish only one. I wanted to have more, but who cared what I wanted. "I'll not wait for you," he said, and left the table. 

Maa, who stood closeby, had a rolling pin in her hand. She looked at me. I thought she would throw the rolling pin on him to break his nose. To my disappointment, she did nothing. She didn’t have the courage to even think about it.

I had the courage, but I kept silent for two reasons: I didn’t want to miss the ride as it was the only time I learned to drive Activa. Our scooter, his only thing I was interested in; and I didn’t want Maa to get a scold because of me.

I sat cross-legged, holding Baba's clean, white shirt. He followed the same old route to the school and his shop, everyday. I knew a shortcut, but who cared what I knew. Baba never talked to me. Maybe, he was still upset with what I did to his nose.

I was the first girl in my family after eight brothers, so Dadi was extremely happy with the news of my birth. She got so excited to see me that she ran with all enthusiasm towards the hospital room. She was a strong woman. She pushed the door with full power without realizing that Baba was standing just behind the door. Frightened with Dadi's sudden attack, he fell flat on the ground, and broke his nose.

From a distance it looked ok, but up close the nose has tilted towards a side. I thought he must be happy with his peculiar nose that made him famous, but who cared what I thought.

Lost in the thought of his nose, I didn’t realize when we reached school. Activa stopped, I got down, and it went on in a jiffy. I hoped that Baba would wish me luck for the dance competition, but I knew, it was a half-hearted hope.

Just a step further, I turned back to realize there was a coin on the road. A kind that I had never seen before. It engraved, 'One Kuwait Dinar.'

That evening was unusual. Maa sat silently in a corner. I threw my bag on the sofa, and went straight to her.

"How was the competition?" she asked without even looking at me.

"We lost," I replied.

"Then why are you so happy?" she stared at me, bamboozled.

"Why is Baba sherlock?" I muttered in an attempt to change the topic. 

"Only God knows, why he has come so early and what he is searching." 

Baba had unsettled the house. She tried to inquire a couple of times, but all in vain. 

She tried again, "what are you looking for?"

"Nothing."

She knew the answer won’t come easily, so she tried again.

"A coin," he replied, in hope for a help.

"What coin?"

"A Kuwaiti Dinar"

"What dinar?"

He didn’t reply as he knew that she knew nothing about it.

But I knew.

I couldn’t believe it was his. For a person who had never stepped out of Meerut, a small city in north India, how did he get the coin? And, why was the coin so special? 

I was eager to find the answer. I knew if I had asked him, I would get only one thing - a slap. So I tried reaching Dadi. We couldn’t connect. Maybe, she was busy holidaying on a beach, hence, not reachable.

I was in seventh heaven. Finally, the time had come to take revenge. I wanted vengeance for all the sacrifies I had to make because of him, including the parathas I couldn’t eat. I was certain that I would never give him the coin, even if Dadi pleads.  

His search became fervent. He yelled at Maa, for the fifth time. She never said anything to him. Her strength was her weakness. But this time, she lost the strength to be patient anymore.

Furiously, she shouted, "who will put the things back in order, your father?"

He ran towards her with a rage in his eyes. I came in between. I opened my fist to show the coin. I didn’t give it to him. His hand hit my cheek. I still didn’t give. The second hit was even harder. It squeezed out the red liquid from my nose. I still didn’t give. Humiliated, he pushed me to the floor and moved towards Maa. Frightened by the next thing that could have happen, I threw it in front of him. 

The anger inside me burst into a fury. I screamed on his face. He didn't give a damn and walked away. I felt miserable as if someone  just spit on me.

For the first time in my life I had something I never wanted to give to anybody, not even Dadi. I couldn’t understand how a coin can be more dearer to him than his daughter. I couldn’t understand the reason for his animus disposition towards us. The thing that I understood was -  I hated him too.

The night got dark, but I was still awake. Suddenly, the door of my room opened. I expected Maa, but it was him. 

He came in and sat next to me. He took out the coin from his pocket and gave it to me.

"We were not as we are today,” he began.

“I know how it feels when you don't know from where you will get your meal when have not eaten for three days. Your grandpa gave this coin to me on his deathbed in a hope to revive our fortune.” A smile emerged on his face as he remembered his father.

He continued, “I began my work at eight in the morning and went on until nine in the evening for 20 years now to give you food, clothe and shelter. But now I realize that in the strugle of life I forgot to give you love.”

He eyes were wet. 

He came closer and said, "One is auspicious as it lays the beginning, and Kuwaiti dinar is the richest currency in the world, so this coin is very special. Your grandpa believed it can change things, and so do I. This is the only thing I have of him, but now I am giving it to you.”

He placed the coin on my palm, and closed the fingers. 

"I hope it will change the things between us. Let's embark a new begining. Take care my love." he said and left the room.

I collapsed into my bed, sobbing, thinking...I was so wrong. 

Unanticipated tears rolled down my eyes. Love is a feeling that has no standard language and every person has its own way of reflection. That moment, I felt the love.

Sooner when the emotional impulse receded, the past tried to became the present and itched the agonies of his deeds. But I had the option to forgive the evil to accept the good. And I preferred to forgive.

"I was wrong, he cares. I wanted to hug him." I thought, and slept the best sleep of my life.
