It was a usual summer morning, sky was bright and clear. Appa was at the breakfast table, exactly at seven. He turned, startled, to find a large cauliflower-shaped lady, his wife, loomed over him to put a Palappam in his plate. I joined late, exactly after 3 minutes. I wondered why he ate only Palappam – day and night. I closed my eyes to ask Achamma, my deceased grandma who was enjoying chicken curry in heaven, ‘Why?’ Even she didn’t know why Appa was so content. I liked chicken curry, but who cared what I liked.

By the time I started, Appa was done. I wanted to have one more, but he’ll not wait, he signaled, and left the table. Amma, who stood close by me, had a tumbler in her hand, filled with filter coffee. She looked at me. I thought she would throw the tumbler on his head to break it into two. His head, not the tumbler. To my disappointment, she did nothing. I wished she had the courage to at-least think about it. 

I had the courage, but I kept silent for two reasons: I didn’t want to walk for 4 kms as I needed to preserve energy for the dance competition; and I didn’t want Amma to get a scold because of me.

I sat on our scooter, cross-legged, holding Abba’s white shirt against which it was impossible to spot a spot. He followed the same route every day. I knew a shortcut, but who cared what I knew. He never speaks to me. Maybe, he is still upset with what I did to his nose.

Achamma was extremely happy with the news of my birth. I was the first girl in the family after eight cousin brothers. She was so excited to see me in the hospital that she ran with all enthusiasm towards the room. She was a strong woman. She pushed the door with full power without realizing Abba was standing behind the door. Frightened with Achamma’s sudden attack, Abba fell flat on the ground, and broke his nose. So the news of my birth was literally a breaking news for him.

From a distance his nose looked ok, but up close it had bent towards a side. I thought he must be happy with his peculiar nose that made him famous, but who cared what I thought. 

Scooter stopped at Gate No. 1, Kendriya Vidhayala, just for a moment, and went on in a jiffy. I hoped that Abba would wish me luck for the competition, but I knew, it was a half-hearted hope. Just a step further, I turned back to notice a coin on the road. A kind that I had never seen before. It was old, rusty, engraved a sword on one side and something on the other that I couldn’t decipher. I looked left, then right, and picked it up.

Suddenly, the evening turned dull, and overcast. I reached home to find Amma sitting silently in a corner, gazing Abba continuously without the drop of a blink. I pulled a chair and sat next to her. 

“How was the competition?” she asked without looking at me. 

“We lost!” I said, casually.

“Then why are you happy?” she stared at me, bamboozled. 

“Why is Abba sherlock?” I asked in an attempt to change the topic.
 
“Only God knows, why he has come early, and what is he doing.” 

Abba had unsettled the house. Cushions on the floor, carpet upside down, chairs on the table. Amma tried to inquire a couple of times, but all in vain.
 
She tried again, “what are you searching?” She knew the answer won’t come easily, so she tried for the third time. 

“A coin” he shouted.
 
“What coin?” 

“Dinar.”
 
“What dinar?”
 
He didn’t reply as he knew that she knew nothing about it. But I knew.
 
I couldn’t believe it was his. For a person who had never stepped out of Kollam, how did he get the coin? And, why was the coin so special? I closed my eyes, but Achamma was not reachable. Maybe, she was busy, holidaying.
 
For the first time in my life I had something that he wanted. Life is uncertain, apt to spring a nasty surprise when we least expect it. I was in seventh heaven. Finally, the time had come to give back the pain. It wanted vengeance for his cruelties. "Swear to all the Palappam I couldn’t eat, I’ll never give it to him", I muttered.

Appa behaved as if he was in hell. His search became fervent. He yelled at Amma for the fifth time. She never said anything to him. Her strength was her weakness. But this time, she had lost the strength to be patient anymore. 

Furiously, she shouted, ‘Who will put the things back in order, your father?’
 
He ran towards her with a rage in his eyes. I had never seen him like that before. Appa is a dark, tall man, a little over middle age, but strong. Frightened by his gaze, I came in between to protect Amma. I opened my fist to show the coin, but I didn’t give. The anger inside him burst into a fury. Then something happened that had never happened. He hit me. It squeezed out the red liquid from my nose. I still didn’t give. Stung by humiliation, he pushed me to the floor. Terrified by the next thing that could have happened, I threw the coin in front of him. He picked it up and walked away.

I sat on the floor with my eyes closed. I felt miserable as if someone had just spit on me. A thunderstorm struck inside me, and outside, it started raining heavily. I couldn’t believe he drew the blood out of his blood just for a coin. I found myself shaken out, sitting aghast. 
 
The night got dark, but I was still awake. Suddenly, the door of my room opened. I expected Amma, but it was him. He came in and sat next to me. 

“I know how it feels when you don’t know from where you will get your meal when have not eaten for three days. I salved away in all seasons, year in and year out, committed to an unvarying routine. My days merged into one indistinguishable blur of eating, sleeping, and getting up, for the only purpose - to give you a life.”   

“Appa gave me this coin on his deathbed. He got it from a merchant who believed it can change things, and so it did, like a magic. This coin brought us luck, and since then, it's always there with me.” A sleek smile emerged on his face as if he remembered his father.

“When I lost the coin, I got scared that the magic will disappear. No matter how ugly the past was, it may return, and this is not what you wish. The very things that make you happy – are also the cause of unhappiness, because the moment these underpinnings are taken away, your happiness crumbles and you cannot help sinking into sorrow.” His face lowered down, damned.

After a moment, he resumed with an unprecedented confidence in his voice.

“All my life, I was continually surrounded by a chorus of voices urging me to earn and grow, without realizing what I’ll do with this all - without you. In this world where everything perishes, I forgot that I can get imperishable happiness in just one thing, you, my love. The thought of losing you scared me so much that I'm not scared of anything now.”

He came closer, took my hand, placed the coin on my palm, and closed the fingers. “This is the only thing I have of my father. It is very close to my heart and will always be, but keep it. What I did, I can’t change, but we can change the future.” He kissed my forehead, and with these words, left the room. 

I collapsed into my bed, sobbing, thinking, I was so wrong. Unanticipated tears rolled down my eyes. Love is a feeling that has no standard language and every person has its own way of reflection. That moment, I felt the love. Sooner when the emotional impulse receded, the past tried to dominate the present. It itched the agonies of his deeds. But I had the option to forgive the evil to accept the good, and I chose to forgive. 

Through tears, I grasped the hard truth that despair can disappear in an instant, without a warning. I sensed an eternal happiness that I hope will not wear thin or fade away. 
 
“I was wrong that who cares. He does.” I thought, and slept the best sleep of my life.
