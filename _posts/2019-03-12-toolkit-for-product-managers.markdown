Product Management wouldn't be easy enough if we were not blessed with availability of so many useful free online applications/ tools. All what you need is a Browser and you are on a roll. 

Here is the list of my favorite online tools that help me accomplish my day-to-day responsibilities:

1. Google Drive: It’s like a locker you can carry anywhere. You can keep all your files inside it with massive 15 GB of free storage space. Very easy to manage, create and share files. Work collaboratively with real-time synchronization.

2. Cacoo: It is a user friendly online drawing tool that allows you to create a variety of diagrams such as site maps, wire frames, UML and network charts. It allows for multiple users to edit the same diagram in a simultaneous collaboration with all the tools and features you would expect from an online wireframe app.

3. Trello: A planning and collaboration product, Trello enables you to organize and prioritize your projects in a fun, flexible, and rewarding way.

4. Google Analytics: Google Analytics is my primary analytics tool of choice. It’s the first thing I set up on every site I’ve built. It provides an API to do even more detailed analysis than the product offers itself. I typically have augmented Google Analytics with home grown tools, but typically have those tools still integrate with Google Analytics.

5. Airtable: An extremely powerful and intuitive tool for organizing anything - spreadsheets, attachments, long text notes, checkboxes, links to records in other tables—even barcodes; share with anyone, work from anywhere.

6. UserVoice: Equally critical to the product role is having a strong understanding of what user’s love, hate, and want to see in your product. UserVoice is my tool of choice for adding a Feedback tab on every page of your site. It then makes it extremely easy for users to send in feedback, vote up existing feedback, and more.

7. Pixlx X: The nextgeneration online photo editor. Pixlr X is the only photo editor you need for quick yet professional edits. Built with cutting edge technology. Provides unprecedented user experience.

8. Typeform: It enables you to build attractive forms & surveys to engage your audience in a conversational manner — and get more data.

9. Axure Cloud: Build prototypes and create design specs. Import screens from other design tools and maintain a single source of truth online. Share automated redlines to developers, discuss changes with on-screen comments, and build interactions – all in the cloud.

10. Collaboratory: Colaboratory is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. With Colaboratory you can write and execute code, save and share your analyses, and access powerful computing resources, all for free from your browser.
