# About

Hola! My name is Sarthak...and I've a standpoint. 

[iStandpoint](https://sarthakgarg.com) is my blog. It's a repository of my beliefs and ideas from which opinions and decisions are formed. It's my legacy.

Iâ€™ve always wanted to write, writing has been very close to my heart for as long as I remember. 

The reason I decided to start a blog was to ink my beliefs and ideas, so that I can do my bit to give back to all those and others from whom I've learned. The very things that makes us, humans, special; the ability to pass on the beliefs and ideas from one person to another.

We often forget that we have a lot more potential and there are infinite things that we can do that exist way beyond our imagination. And the fastest way to do the unprecedented is not re-invent the wheel, but build upon the beliefs and ideas of somebody who's a little ahead of the thinking curve. Remember, we are a speck of dust in this tiny solar system and there are billion more minds out there, thinking. 

Life is not a 100 meter sprint, but a 'Relay' race whereby we accept the baton from those that passed this way before, do our best, and then attempt to pass the baton on without fumbling it. This is how mankind has evolved, one individual, one group, one generation learning from, and building upon what went before. Our job is to, at very least, 'pass the baton'!
