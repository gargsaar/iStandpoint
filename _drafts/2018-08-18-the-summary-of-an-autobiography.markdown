Imagined the summary of a to be written autobiography.

---------

'A Nice Guy Who Didn’t Finish Last' was a dream seen by Aakash Salvi a year ago. For him, he became a father again the day he realised this dream. In an interview, he said, "My autobiography is my second child, but first childbirth. And I enjoyed each day of my pregnancy." Every word has been written with utmost care and love. He has divided the book in 3 chapters describing his life journey beautifully through short stories.

Chapter One - 'The Incarnation'. It has stories from his childhood. It begins with a funny story about how he came into this world and the news of his birth became a breaking news. His childhood stories revolve around interesting characters such as his overprotective grandma who fought the world to protect him from an evil eye, his troop of cousins who were on a mission to save the world, and his super-rich uncle who almost made him a supermodel when he was just five. These light-hearted stories are bound to take you back into your childhood, and that too with a smile.

Chapter Two - 'The Destruction'. It narrates his struggles with love and life. It starts with a heartbreaking story on - how despite being in love, he ended up single. The tale of his woes continues with stories on his 33 failures. He failed in almost everything he did.

Chapter Three - 'The Reincarnation'. It describes how Aakash Salivi, as a human being, is special. What he did to be so successful. Most importantly, when he was there at the top, how did he sustain.

This book is an inspiration for those who think they are fortunate to have a life in which they can see, hear and speak, but don't know how to make it count. It is for those who want to make life immortal and have their memories remain. Aakash has an uncanny ability to bring out humour in even otherwise ordinary looking incidents which makes this motivational book a laughter ride.
