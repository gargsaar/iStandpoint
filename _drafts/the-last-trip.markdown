Aakriti's leave request got approved, finally, after six months. She was very exicited for her vacation. She was an overprotected young girl whose life revolved around a handful of people who were loving, caring, and contented. Fed of her mediocre life, she wanted to experience the ugly side of humanity. 

She decided to go on a vacation, all alone.

Tarun was both happy and worried. He wasn't sure how Aakriti will manage without him. She had never gone outstation without him in last 7 years. "Are you sure you don’t want your bodyguard?" Tarun said, in a loving voice.

She gave her pullover the last turn to fold it compactly. She adjusted it in an overfilled, Swaine Adeney Brigg’s Windsor leather bag that Tarun got for her from New York, last month, on her 25th birthday. She walked towards Tarun who was seated on a wingback accent chair. She sat on his lap. She could see the fear in his eyes. They kissed.

convincingly, she said, "Baby, I'll be fine."

"Ya, I know you will be. It's just you are not even taking your phone along, so I'm a little worried."

"Don’t be. It's just two weeks. I want to be just with myself."

Tarun wanted Aakriti to break her dogma that contentdness is malediction. Soon after the trip they plan to become parent, so she may not get this chance again. He knew this trip was the best way for her to realise how lucky she was to live an affuluent life.

For an otherwise detailed planner, it wasn't easy for her to not plan for the trip. She didn't check for travel options, hotel, or weather. The only thing she googled was "India's most dangerous place", and 'Bastar' became her destination.

In the heist, she understood the universal purpose of life. It was to obtain an unshakable spirit or in plain words, lasting joyfulness. Most people think their career, family, or job titles are the reasons for their living. But those are not the ultimate purpose of life but rather short or mid-term goals.

Animals are familiar with objective entities outside them, such as trees, rocks and rivers, and subjective experiences within them, such as fear, joy and desire. Humans, in addition, are concious of money, gods, nations and corporations. The Cognitive ability enables humans  to start talking about things that existed only in their own imagination. These fictious ideas helps in collaborationa and effective cooperation. Today, corporations are fictional legal entities that own property, lend money, hire employees and initiate economic enterprises.
