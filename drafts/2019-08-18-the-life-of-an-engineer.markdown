"It sucks being an engineer" was the tagline of our club. It wasn't a formal college club, but a four people brotherhhod formed by frusted, obviously "Nice Guys". The club was headed by me, the male protaganist, Aditya Shaurya. We had only two problems in life. First, why people outside an engineering college think that engieering is a great profession. Second, why "Nice Guys" always finish last. Second is an interesting story.  Maybe for sometime later.

Why don't these professors understand the pain and attrocities we engineer has to suffer. 

An engineer enters into the college and suffeing begins. When economic students are studying about taxes, balance sheet which they will use in their lives. When art students are being taught about romance, love which they will use in their lives. We are taught about how to measure tension. I mean look at the problem - a monkey is hanging from a tree, another monkey is hanging on its tail. Find the tension in the tail. 

Monkey one has no problem in hanging on the tree, in-fact this is what monkeys do. Monkey two seems to enjoy the process on hanging on the tail. Then who are we to find the tension among them.

In four years of engineering, what have you learned, except - how to use google chrome incognito, and how to get rid of google history. 

That is why I always say engineering should be virginieering.
