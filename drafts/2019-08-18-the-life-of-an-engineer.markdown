"It sucks being an engineer" was the tagline of our club. It wasn't a formal college club, but a four people brotherhhod formed by frusted, obviously "Nice Guys". The club was headed by me, the male protaganist, Aditya Shaurya. We had only two problems in life. First, why people outside an engineering college think that engieering is a great profession. Second, why "Nice Guys" always finish last. Second is an interesting story.  Maybe for sometime later.

Why don't these professors understand the pain and attrocities we engineer has to suffer. 

An engineer enters into the college and suffeing begins. When economic students are studying about taxes, balance sheet which they will use in their lives. When art students are being taught about romance, love which they will use in their lives. We are taught about how to measure tension. I mean look at the problem - a monkey is hanging from a tree, another monkey is hanging on its tail. Find the tension in the tail. 

Monkey one has no problem in hanging on the tree, in-fact this is what monkeys do. Monkey two seems to enjoy the process on hanging on the tail. Then who are we to find the tension among them.

In four years of engineering, what have you learned, except - how to use google chrome incognito, and how to get rid of google history. 

That is why I always say engineering should be virginieering.

I made my entry in this world once upon a time. I was the first boy of my generation. My grandma was extremely happy with the news of my birth. She was so excited that she ran with all enthusiasm to see me in the hospital room. She was a strong woman. She pushed the door of the room with full power without realising that Dr. Kirti Vyas, my gynecologist, was standing behind the door. Dr. Kirti was a thin and elegant young lady. Frightened with grandmaâ€™s sudden attack, she fell flat on the ground. She broke her nose. Unfortunate for her, but the news of my birth became a breaking news!

I was very popular in college. I used to give support, do favours, do everything consistent with the general meaning of the term nice. In-fact, I was so nice that I never took any advantage of a drunken female friend while escorting her back from parties to her bed, no matter how much she insisted. I was the perfect boyfriend material who never ended up being a boyfriend. For all the nice guys out there and ladies who are single, I want say that nice guys may not end up being boyfriends, but trust me, they are very good husband material.
