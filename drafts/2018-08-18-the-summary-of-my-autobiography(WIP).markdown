Imagined the summary of a to be written autobiography.

---------

'A Nice Guy Who Didnâ€™t Finish Last' was a dream seen by Aakash Salvi few years ago. For him, he became a father once again the day he realized his dream. His autobiography is his first book, a second child and it reflects in every word which has been written with utmost care and love.

This book is divided into parts which he calls 'The three phases of my life'. Each part describes his life journey through interesting short stories.

Part One has stories from his childhood. This part begins with a funny story about how he came into this world and the news of his birth became a Breaking News.

All the stories in this part revolve around very interesting real-life characters such as: his overprotective grandma who fought the world to protect him from evil eyes, his troop of cousins who were on a mission to save the world, and his super rich uncle who wanted to make him a supermodel. These lighthearted stories are bound to take you back into your childhood and that too with a laughter.

Part Two is about the struggles. How despite being in love, he ended up being single. And how he stood-up every time from failures for thirteen times in a row. These stories about his struggles on both personal and professional front are thought provoking and life changing. 

Part Three talks about the success. It narrates how he shaped his life to make it immortal. What he did so that his memories remained. This part will be an inspiration for those who think they are fortunate to have a life in which they can see, hear and speak. It is for those want to make their life memorable.
