Begin a new story by creating a character. What do they look like? How do they dress? Is there anything unusual about their appearance? Write a scene or story exploring your new character.

The ocean breeze was playing with her long brown hair, swinging them left to right in tandem. Taller than an average Indian girl, she stood out. Sitting on a rock in a corner at the beach, I couldn’t take my eyes off her. Her carefully chiselled body had all the curves to perfection. She wasn’t fair, but her dusky complexion had an unusual attraction. Her mulberry silk like smooth skin allowed the water droplets to travel flawlessly from the top of her hand, through her long fingers, to all the way down from where they had emerged. I was desperate to see her face, but the breeze was in no mood to stop.

Her white Natté gabardine top only covered her boobs and belly. It looked like Parada or definitely something I couldn't have afford. The pink mini skirt with a floral design was just enough to cover the groin. Her toned upper thighs and tight calf muscles left no doubts in my mind that she was an athlete. 

She was beautiful and alone, but where were her shoes?
