Aakriti's leave request finally got approved. She was taking off from work after a long time. She wanted to go on a seven days trip to Kasol, all alone. She was an overprotected young girl whose life revolved around a handful of people who were loving, caring, and contented. She was frustated by her mediocre life. She wanted to experience the ugly side of humanity.

Tarun was both happy and worried for her. She had never gone outstation without him in last 7 years.

"Are you sure you don’t want your bodyguard?" Tarun said, in a loving voice.

"Baby, I'll be fine." she reassured, convincingly.

"Ya, I know you will be. It's just you are going without me for the first time, so I'm a little worried."

Aakriti didn't plan her trip. No prior travel bookings or hotel arrangements. 

It was a very well planned trip. They took Volvo from Anand Vihar, ISBT bus station, in East Delhi on a Thursday. Volvo started on time at 11PM and was supposed to reach Kasuli early morning around 5:30AM. Aakriti started thinking what bad could happen with her on the trip. Her limited knowledge in this area for otherwise an intelligent software product manager left her brain to produce only a few options: natural calamity, fraud, molestation.   Nothing happened with the volvo, no flat tire,  no hijack, no eve-teasing. They reached Kasuli on time.   Aakriti had booked a newly opened hotel of a popular hotel chain. The location was remote, about 20 kilometres from the main city, but they managed to bargain a good rate. Its olympic size, temperature controlled, indoor swimming pool had hypnotised Aakriti.
