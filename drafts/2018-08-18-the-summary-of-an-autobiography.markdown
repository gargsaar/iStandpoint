Imagined the summary of a to be written autobiography.

---------

'A Nice Guy Who Didnâ€™t Finish Last' was a dream seen by Aakash Salvi few years ago. For him, he became a father again the day he realized his dream. His autobiography is his first book and second child, and it reflects in every word which has been written with utmost care and love.

This book is divided into three parts which Aakash calls 'The three phases of my life'. Each part describes his life journey through interesting short stories.

Part One has stories from his childhood. This part begins with a funny story about how he came into this world and the news of his birth became a Breaking News. 

All the stories in this part revolve around very interesting real-life characters such as his overprotective grandma who fought the world to protect him from an evil eye, his troop of cousins who were on a mission to save the world, and his uncle who almost made him a supermodel when he was just five. 

These lighthearted stories are bound to take you, readers, back into your childhood, and that too with a smile. Aakash has an uncanny ability to bring out humor in even otherwise ordinary looking incidents which makes this book a laughter ride.

Part Two is about his struggles with love and life. It starts with a heartbreaking story on how despite being in love he ended up being single. And the tale of his woes continues to end at a node which sets a perfect plot for the next part.

Part Three narrates how Aakash is special. How he shaped his life to make it immortal, and once successful, what he did to sustain. This part will be an inspiration for those who think they are fortunate to have a life in which they can see, hear and speak, but don't know how to make it count. This part is for those who want to have their memories remain.
